This is the source code for www.koora2014.com

It is an application to run a World Cup pool (a Predictor game where users enter scores up to two hours before the start of each game then get points according to the result) that I built end to end over two weekends. Built on a MEAN technology stack, MongoDb, NodeJS and AngularJS, Bootstrap responsive theme, deployed on Heroku, a proper build and deployment process using grunt etc...

This was an interesting exercise in Rapid development and a JFDI process. The site functioned very well, including the logic for all the calculations for scoring points, admin and update of scores and users, and securing all of it against multiple attempts of rigging the results from my friends. It proved quiet addictive and successful among colleagues and friends.

To test functionality (although you can't enter scores now that the World Cup is over obviously), please go to www.koora2014.com and login using
