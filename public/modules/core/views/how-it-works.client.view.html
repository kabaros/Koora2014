				<p>
					Register, add all your predictions (or predict each game before its start), also predict the final and winner before the end of the first round of the group stage. 
					<br/><br/>
					Sit back and relax and we will do the calculations and run the pool. No paper work, no Excel sheets, no hassle.
					<br/><br/>
						You might even win amazing Prizes! 
					<br/>
					<small>(probably not but it's still fun)</small>

					<h3>Scoring</h3>
					<p>
						 <strong>5 points</strong> for a correct score.<br/>
						 3 points for a correct outcome.<br/>
						 -1 point for a wrong outcome.<br/><br/>

						 You also predict the two finalists and the winner. (each worth 50 points) <br/><br/>
						 Predictions will be locked two hours before the start of each game.

					<h3>Leagues</h3>
					<p>

					Start a League (i.e. MyCompany's league) and invite your friends to join it. You will then have extra options and custom rankings between members of that League. 
				 You could organize the League internally to have prizes or sweepstakes while not worrying about running the pool and competition.
					<br/><br/>
					Your League will also be ranked (as a whole) against the rest of the world.
